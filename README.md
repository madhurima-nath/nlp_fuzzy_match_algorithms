# WWCode Data Science: NLP Fuzzy Match Algorithms

The following topics are covered in the session. 


Fuzzy string matching is technique to find strings which have approximate matches. 
There are multiple applications of fuzzy matching - finding golden unique records in master
data managements to correcting typing errors to giving correct suggestion to free form texts. 
This talk will cover a few algorithms which are implemented for such approximate string matchings.

Outline of the talk:    
  - Introduction to fuzzy string matching (~5 minutes)    
  - Algorithms to implement fuzzy matching: (~15 minutes)       
    1. Levenshtein distance algorithm: metric to measure distance between two string sequences 
    2. Damerau–Levenshtein distance algorithm: metric to measure edit distance (how dissimilar two strings are) 
    3. Bitmap algorithm
    4. n-gram algorithm: a probabilistic language model to predict the next item in such a sequence in the form of a (n − 1)–order Markov mode
  -  Walk through of an example of fuzzy string matching (~10 minutes)    
  -  Q/A (~10-15 minutes)
